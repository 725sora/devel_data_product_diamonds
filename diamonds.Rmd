```


```{r, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
data("diamonds")
```

## Introduction to the data set diamonds

- The data set "diamonds" is part of the ggplot2 library
- The data frame size: 10 variables and 53940 observables 
- An analysis between the variabes price, carat, cut, clarity might be interesting

## Summary of the data set

```{r, echo=TRUE}
str(diamonds)
```

## 3D scatter plot

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
plot_ly(diamonds, x=~carat, y=~cut, z=~price, color = ~color)
```

## Next Steps

From the 3D scatter plot we can see following phenomena, which requires a deeper analysis:

- The diamond size (carat) has a large impact on the price 
- The color seems to have also a large impact on the price
